# The Data Visualization Checklist

This checklist contains some questions you might want to ask yourself when starting to 
design your data visualization. They are guidelines, not set in stone, and are designed to 
help you. You can come back to them while you make your plot to help remind you of your goals 
and ideas. At first, this might look like it could take a long time to do for a single figure. 
But after a while, these questions become ingrained and you will answer them automatically.

### 1) Who is your audience?
Are you making your figure to present at a conference? On a poster? To scientists or the general audience? Will it be printed in a newspaper?

### 2) What Type of Data do I have?

Is your data continuous or categorical? Is it a time series or a statistical distribution? 
What am I trying to display?

### 3) What are the important points I want to emphasize with the visualization?
Do I care mostly about the outliers in my data set? Do I want to showcase trends? Am I interested 
in proportionalities or absolute values of quantities?
If there are multiple statements you want to make with the data, sort them by importance!

### 4) What is the most appropriate type of data visualization for my data/problem?
Different types of plots are best suited for different types of data. For example, stacked bar charts are good 
at displaying part-to-whole relationships, line graphs work for time series. 

### 5) How do the different parts of my plot relate to each other?
Do I have more than one type of data on my plot? What is the relationship between these parts?
Are they clearly distinguishable? Where does my legend go? This is where you want to think about gestalt principles and 
how to work with space.

### 6) What should the visual hierarchy in my visualization be?
To answer this question, you want to sort the pieces of information by importance: which pieces of information do 
you want viewers to glean immediately (e.g. via pre-attentive processing), which are details that can take more time 
or are less important? Go back to question 2 and compare whether your proposed visual hierarchy matches the 
statements wou want to make?

### 7) What symbols/colours/line shapes/... should I use?
How can I encode the visual hierarchy I've settled on in question 5 into actual visual elements? 

### 8) What other elements does my plot need?
Do I need e.g. an arrow to guide the eye to the most important piece of information? Should I encircle a group 
of particularly relevant data points? How can I use gestalt principles to put emphasis on the parts of my figure 
that will make my point most clearly? 

### 9) What other information should my figure include?
Do I need a legend? Is it easy to map between legend and data? Have I considered axis labels and a title? 
Hint: If you need to put the values of all of your data points on your visualization, it is *not* a good visualization (see also examples in the slides!).
