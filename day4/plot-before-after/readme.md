# Plots: Before-and-After

<img src='IMG_2695.JPG' width=400px>

As part of our lecture/tutorial on data visualization from Astro Hack Week 2017, groups of participants picked plots (or figures, graphs, etc) to modify using some of the principles of perception and visualization we discussed. Each group was given graph paper and colored pens/pencils to help brainstorm "better" ways to create each graph. These sketches represent a snapshot of the actual creative and scientific process, and it was amazing to overhear all the fascinating discussions about both the visualizations and also the audience/focus.

Here we present the Before & After images, as well as the sketches where the final product was imagined.

Project Salad vs Burger: Mose Giordano, Itamar Reis and Brianna Irish worked on different plotting visualization of valid data to conceptualization the data in both code and presentation. This reflects real time highlights the important of clear, clean, impact messages that transmits the data in seconds within a  presentation. We stopped and talked about who and what we wanted to convey to different audiences such as children, office meeting or government review plotting points. By making the transmission of information clean and contemporary we are highlighting the substantiation  of the important data.  This makes the facts of comparison stronger and well thought out. We tried playing with different puts of size, color, coding and display options of color theory with the  presentation.  Materials: Matplotlib, Colored Pens, Paper and Microsoft Excel Graphing.
